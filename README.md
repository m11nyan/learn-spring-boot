## Project Overview

The **Learn Spring Boot** project aims to provide a comprehensive example of a tech store application. This application demonstrates how to build a secure, responsive web application using the Spring framework. The project showcases how to manage products, handle user authentication, and create a dynamic user interface.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration using Spring Security.
- **Product Management**: Admin panel to add, edit, and delete products.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Bootstrap for a mobile-friendly interface.
- **Database Integration**: Utilizes MySQL for data storage and retrieval.
- **Dynamic Pages**: Thymeleaf templates for rendering HTML pages.

## Technologies Used

This project incorporates several technologies to create a seamless experience:

- **Spring Boot**: A framework that simplifies the setup and development of new Spring applications.
- **Thymeleaf**: A modern server-side Java template engine for web applications.
- **Bootstrap**: A front-end framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites.
- **Spring Security**: A powerful authentication and access-control framework.
- **MySQL**: A relational database management system for storing application data.
- **Maven**: A build automation tool used primarily for Java projects.
